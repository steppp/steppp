### Hi there, I am Stefano 👋 

🎓 I'm a Front End Developer currently working for a company based in Bologna 🇮🇹 and I graduated in March 2021 in Computer Science with a thesis on tomographic image enhancement using neural networks (available soon).

⛳️ I am familiar with different framework and languages:
  - C# and .NET 5.0
  - Typescript, Javascript, CSS, HTML5 and Angular
  - Swift and UIKit
  - Python

💻 I am very interested in the Swift programming language and all the  Apple ecosystem. I would love to be involved in graphics programming and work in a cutting-edge enviroment, so feel free to drop a message if I look like a good candidate for both of these contexts.

🔀 I am a big fan of functional programming concepts in languages and I like clean, well-strutured code. I consider myself a quite good programmer (modesty, huh?) and in general I always managed to solve every problem I faced.

That's it for now, have a nice day!⭐️
