### Hi there, I am Stefano 👋 

🎓 I'm a Front End Developer currently working for a company based in Bologna 🇮🇹 and I graduated in March 2021 in Computer Science with a thesis on tomographic image enhancement using neural networks (get the paper [here](https://amslaurea.unibo.it/id/eprint/22843)).

⛳️ I am familiar with different framework and languages:
  - C# and .NET 5.0
  - Typescript, Javascript, CSS, HTML5 and Angular
  - WebGL and THREE.js
  - Swift, UIKit and SwiftUI
  - Python

🌴 I've attended [THREE.js journey](https://threejs-journey.xyz), a wonderful course on the famous WebGL library.

📚 I'm currently experimenting with shaders reading the awesome [book of shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com) and rebuilding my personal website (you can find the repo [here](https://github.com/steppp/site-webgl-rework)).

💻 I am very interested in the Swift programming language and all the  Apple ecosystem. I would love to be involved in graphics programming and work in a cutting-edge enviroment, so feel free to drop a message if I look like a good candidate for either of these contexts.

🔀 I am a big fan of functional programming concepts in languages and I like clean, well-strutured code. In general I always managed to solve every problem I faced and I am familiar with most programming concepts so adopting a new technology/framework usually do not take long to me.

That's it for now, have a nice day!⭐️
